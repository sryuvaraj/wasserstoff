# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## How I approached the task
 I approached the task by first understanding the requirements thoroughly. This involved carefully reading the task prompt to identify key points such as the desired outcome, specific functionalities required, and any constraints or guidelines provided. Next, I broke down the task into smaller steps to make it more manageable. This allowed me to create a clear plan of action, outlining the main components needed for the solution. Afterwards, I started by addressing the main functionality required, such as creating React components, handling state with useState, implementing image sliders, and toggling between event and collectible views. I paid attention to the design aspects, ensuring that the components were visually appealing and responsive. This involved using Tailwind CSS for styling to make the layout more dynamic and adjusting the CSS properties to achieve the desired look and feel.For the image slider functionality, I implemented logic using useState and useEffect hooks to manage the slide index and transition between slides. This allowed for smooth and automatic sliding of images, creating a carousel-like effect.Throughout the process, I continuously tested the code to ensure each feature was working as expected and made adjustments where necessary. Once everything was working as intended, I documented the steps taken to provide a clear explanation of the approach for the interview task.Overall, my approach focused on understanding the requirements, breaking down the task into manageable steps, implementing the necessary functionality with React and Tailwind CSS, and testing rigorously to ensure a polished and functional solution.
